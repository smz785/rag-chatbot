Key limitations:

1.Embedding quality varies: nomic-embed-text is good enough for demos, not always for production.
2.No guaranteed citations: still enforcing grounding in prompts.
3.Compute: if laptop is weak, the chatbot will be slow. That’s not a code issue.

  "answer": "Semantic data modeling refers to the process of creating a graph-based model that represents data as nodes (semantic objects), edges (relationships between objects), attributes (properties of objects), and measures (aggregate metrics). This approach enables the use of semantic data models directly with SQL, allowing for more flexible and efficient querying of complex business logic.",
